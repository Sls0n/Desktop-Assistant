# Desktop-Assistant
A simple desktop assistant that can do few tasks made using Python! (Under progess)

You can use this assistant to automate regular, repetitive and boring tasks like opening a app, inquiring definition of something, fetching summary from wikipedia, searching for files, checking messages, sending emails, asking for date & time, opening browser and many more!
However to use this you'll need to install some Python packages i.e. pyttsx3, speech_recognition, wikipedia, webbrowser, keyboard.
To install :-
1) Download & install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads (Made in version 3.10.4)
2) Then open CMD with admin privilege and copy paste these commands one by one -->
         → pip install keyboard
         → pip install webbrowser
         → pip install speech_recognition
         → pip install wikipedia
         → pip insall pyttsx3

This is a work in progress and is only a prototype!
